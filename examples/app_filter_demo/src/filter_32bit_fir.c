  /**
   * In this example we'll look at how to use the 32-bit FIR filtering functions.
   *
   * The applied filter logic is approximately:
   *
   *    output[n] = sum_k{ (input[n-k] * b[k]) >> 30 } >> shift
   *    where
   *      > output[n] is the filter output at time n
   *      > input[n-k] is the filter input k time steps before time n
   *      > b[k] is the user-supplied filter coefficient associated with time lag k
   *          (i.e. larger k is applied to older samples)
   *      > shift is a user-specified power-of-two scale factor
   *      > sum_k{} is a sum over variable k with   0 < k < N_taps, and
   *      > N_taps is the number of filter taps.
   *
   * The multiplication inside the sum is a full 64-bit multiplication with a built-in 30-bit
   * rounding right-shift (as shown).  The maximum value of any such product is then
   *   ((-2^31)*(-2^31)*(2^(-30))) = 2^(62-30) = 2^(32).  These (effectively 33-bit) products
   * are accumulated into a set of 8 internal 40-bit saturating accumulators, accumulator p
   * containing the partial sum of the filter indices p mod 8.  The 8 accumulators containing the
   * 40-bit partial sums are then added together for an (at-most) 43-bit final sum. Finally, a
   * rounding, saturating right-shift of `shift` bits is applied to the 43-bit sum to get the
   * final result which is output.  The final shift saturates to the symmetric 32-bit bounds
   * of INT32_MAX and -INT32_MAX.  (Note that each of the 40-bit accumulators saturates to
   * symmetric 40-bit bounds.)
   *
   * Below we'll declare and initialize a 32-bit FIR filter with TAP_COUNT random coefficients.
   * We'll then iterate for TAP_COUNT steps, adding samples to the filter without actually computing
   * the filter output. Finally, we'll iterate another FILTER_TICKS steps, adding random samples to
   * the filter and calculating the outputs.
