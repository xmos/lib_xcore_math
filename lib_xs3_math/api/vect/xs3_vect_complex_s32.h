/**
 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and shifts needed by xs3_vect_complex_s32_macc().
 *
 * This function is used in conjunction with xs3_vect_complex_s32_macc() to perform an element-wise
 * multiply-accumlate of 32-bit BFP vectors.
 *
 * This function computes `new_acc_exp`, `acc_shr`, `b_shr` and `c_shr`, which are selected to
 * maximize precision in the resulting accumulator vector without causing saturation of final or
 * intermediate values. Normally the caller will pass these outputs to their corresponding inputs of
 * xs3_vect_complex_s32_macc().
 *
 * `acc_exp` is the exponent associated with the accumulator mantissa vector @vector{a} prior to the
 * operation, whereas `new_acc_exp` is the exponent corresponding to the updated accumulator vector.
 *
 * `b_exp` and `c_exp` are the exponents associated with the complex input mantissa vectors
 * @vector{b} and @vector{c} respectively.
 *
 * `acc_hr`, `b_hr` and `c_hr` are the headrooms of @vector{a}, @vector{b} and @vector{c}
 * respectively. If the headroom of any of these vectors is unknown, it can be obtained by calling
 * xs3_vect_complex_s32_headroom(). Alternatively, the value `0` can always be safely used (but may
 * result in reduced precision).

 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating
 * fixed-point arithmetic), the `acc_shr` and `bc_sat` produced by this function can be adjusted
 * according to the following: 
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *      // Presumed to be set somewhere
 *      exponent_t acc_exp, b_exp, c_exp;
 *      headroom_t acc_hr, b_hr, c_hr;

 *      acc_shr += mant_shr;

 *      
 *      // acc_shr, b_shr and c_shr may now be used in a call to xs3_vect_complex_s32_macc() 
 * @endcode
 *
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following conditions should be maintained:
 * * `acc_shr > -acc_hr`  (Shifting any further left may cause saturation)
 * * `b_shr => -b_hr`  (Shifting any further left may cause saturation)
 * * `c_shr => -c_hr`  (Shifting any further left may cause saturation)
 *
 * It is up to the user to ensure any such modification does not result in saturation or
 * unacceptable loss of precision.

 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and input shifts used by xs3_vect_complex_s32_mul() and

 * 
 * This function is used in conjunction with xs3_vect_complex_s32_mul() to perform a complex element-wise multiplication
 * of two complex 32-bit BFP vectors.
 * 
 * This function computes `a_exp`, `b_shr` and `c_shr`.
 * 
 * `a_exp` is the exponent associated with mantissa vector @vector{a}, and must be chosen to be large enough to avoid 
 * overflow when elements of @vector{a} are computed. To maximize precision, this function chooses `a_exp` to be the 
 * smallest exponent known to avoid saturation (see exception below). The `a_exp` chosen by this function is derived 
 * from the exponents and headrooms of associated with the input vectors.
 * 
 * `b_shr` and `c_shr` are the shift parameters required by xs3_vect_complex_s32_mul() to achieve the chosen output 
 * exponent `a_exp`.
 * 
 * `b_exp` and `c_exp` are the exponents associated with the input mantissa vectors @vector{b} and @vector{c} 
 * respectively.
 * 
 * `b_hr` and `c_hr` are the headroom of @vector{b} and @vector{c} respectively. If the headroom of @vector{b} or 
 * @vector{c} is unknown, they can be obtained by calling xs3_vect_complex_s32_headroom(). Alternatively, the value `0`
 * can always be safely used (but may result in reduced precision).
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * @parblock
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `b_shr` and `c_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      right_shift_t new_b_shr = b_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 *      right_shift_t new_c_shr = c_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following conditions should be maintained:
 * * `b_hr + b_shr >= 0`
 * * `c_hr + c_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using smaller values than strictly necessary for `b_shr` and `c_shr` can result in saturation, and 
 * using larger values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * 
 * * Using the outputs of this function, an output mantissa which would otherwise be `INT32_MIN` will instead saturate 
 *   to `-INT32_MAX`. This is due to the symmetric saturation logic employed by the VPU and is a hardware feature. This 
 *   is a corner case which is usually unlikely and results in 1 LSb of error when it occurs.
