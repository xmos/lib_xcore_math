 * @brief 32-bit Discrete-Time Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter
 * 
 * @todo Move most of this information out to higher-level documentation
 * 
 * @par Filter Model
 * @parblock
 * 
 * This struct represents an N-tap 32-bit discrete-time FIR Filter.
 * 
 * At each time step, the FIR filter consumes a single 32-bit input sample and produces a single 32-bit output sample.
 * 
 * To process a new input sample and compute a new output sample, use xs3_filter_fir_s32(). To add a new input sample
 * to the filter without computing a new output sample, use xs3_filter_fir_s32_add_sample().
 * 
 * An `N`-tap FIR filter contains `N` 32-bit cofficients (pointed to by `coef`) and `N` words of state data (pointed to
 * by `state`. The state data is a vector of the `N` most recent input samples. When processing a new input sample at 
 * time step `t`, `x[t]` is the new input sample, `x[t-1]` is the previous input sample, and so on, up to `x[t-(N-1)]`,
 * which is the oldest input considered when computing the new output sample (see note 1 below). The coefficients form a 
 * vector `b[]`, where `b[k]` is the coefficient by which the `k`th oldest input sample is multiplied. There is an 
 * additional parameter `shift` which scales the output as described below. Both the coefficients and `shift` are 
 * considered to be constants which do not change after initialization (although nothing should break if they are 
 * changed to new valid values).
 * 
 * At time step `t`, the output sample `y[t]` is computed based on the inner product (i.e. sum of element-wise products) 
 * of the coefficients and state data as follows (a more detailed description is below):
 * 
 *     acc = x[t-0] * b[0] + x[t-1] * b[1] + x[t-2] * b[2] + ... + x[t-(N-1)] * b[N-1]
 *     y[t] = acc >> shift
 * 
 * Importantly, all three of the operators above (addition, multiplication and the rightwards bit-shift) have slightly
 * ideosyncratic meanings. 
 * 
 * The products have a built-in rounding arithmetic right-shift of 30 bits, where ties round toward positive infinity. 
 * This is a hardware feature which allows for longer filters (larger `N`) without sacrificing coefficient precision. 
 * These element-wise products accumulate into 8 40-bit accumulators saturate the sums at symmetric 40-bit bounds (see 
 * @ref saturation). The order in which the taps are accumulated is unspecified (see note 2 below).
 * 
 * After each tap has been accumulated, the 8 accumulators are then added together to get a 64-bit penultimate result 
 * (with 43 useful bits). Finally, an unsigned rounding arithmetic right-shift of `shift` bits is applied to the 64-bit 
 * sum, and the final result is saturated to the symmetric 32-bit range (`-INT32_MAX` to `INT32_MAX` inclusive).
 * 
 * Below is a more detailed description of the operations performed (not including the saturation logic applied by the
 * accumulators).
 * 
 * @f[
 * 
 * &    y[t] = sat_{32} \left(
 *               round \left( 
 *                 \left(
 *                   \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} round(x[t-k] \cdot b[k] \cdot 2^{-30}) 
 *                 \right) \cdot 2^{-shift}
 *               \right)
 *             \right)                                                          \\

 * @par Operations
 * @parblock
 * 
 * **Initialize**: A `xs3_filter_fir_s32_t` filter is initialized with a call to xs3_filter_fir_s32_init(). The caller 
 * supplies information about the filter, including the number of taps and pointers the coefficients and a state buffer. 
 * It is typically recommended that the state buffer be cleared to all `0`s before initializing.
 * 
 * **Add Sample**: To add a new input sample without computing a new output sample, use 
 * xs3_filter_fir_s32_add_sample(). This is a constant-time operation which does not depend on the number of filter 
 * taps. This may be useful in some situations, for example, to quickly pre-load the filter's state buffer with multiple 
 * samples, without incurring the cost of computing an output with each added sample.
 * 
 * **Process Sample**: To process a new input sample and produce a new output sample, use xs3_filter_fir_s32().  
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Fields
 * @parblock
 * 
 * After initialization via xs3_filter_fir_s32_init(), the contents of the `xs3_filter_fir_s32_t` struct are considered
 * to be opaque, and may change between major versions. In general, user code should not need to access its members.
 * 
 * `num_taps` is the order of the filter, or the number of taps. It is also the (minimum) size of the buffers to which
 * `coef` and `state` point, in elements (where each element is 4 bytes). The time required to process an input sample
 * and produce an output sample is approximately linear in `num_taps` (see Performance below).
 * 
 * `head` is the index into `state` at which the next sample will be added.
 * 
 * `shift` is the unsigned arithmetic rounding saturating right-shift applied to internal accumulator to get a final
 * output.
 * 
 * `coef` is a pointer to a buffer (supplied by the user at initialization) containing the tap coefficients. The 
 * coefficients are stored in forward order, with lower indices corresponding to newer samples. `coef[0]`, then, 
 * corresponds to `b[0]`, `coef[1]` to `b[1]`, and so on. None of the functions which operate on `xs3_filter_fir_s32_t`
 * structs in this library will modify the contents of the buffer to which `coef` points. This buffer must be at least
 * `num_taps` words long.
 * 
 * `state` is a pointer to a buffer (supplied by the user at initialization) containing the state data -- a history of
 * the `num_taps` most recent input samples. `state` is used in a circular fashion with `head` indicating the index at
 * which the next sample will be inserted.
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Performance
 * @parblock
 * 
 * More work remains to fully characterize the time performance of this FIR filter, but asymptotically (i.e. with a 
 * large number of filter taps) processing a new input sample to produce a new output sample takes approximately 3 
 * thread cycles per 8 filter taps.
 * 
 * That assumes that both the coefficients (pointed to by `coef`) and state buffer (pointed to by `state`) are stored
 * directly in SRAM.
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @todo If the function takes `S * num_taps + V` thread cycles, what is `V`?
 * @todo When there are fewer than `M` taps, it is more efficient to just use a C implementation of an FIR filter. What
 *       is `M`?
 * @todo Brief explanation of how thread cycles correspond to actual time.
 * 
 * 
 * @par Coefficient Scaling
 * @parblock
 * 
 * Suppose you're starting with a floating-point FIR filter model with coefficients `B[k]` which operates on a sequence 
 * of 32-bit integer input samples `x[t]` to get a result `Y[t]` where
 * 
 *      Y[t] = x[t-0] * B[0] + x[t-1] * B[1] + ... + x[t-(N-1)] * B[N-1]
 * 
 * Because of the 30-bit right-shift and the right-shift of the final accumulator by `shift` bits, the coefficients 
 * `b[k]` to use with this library can be thought of as fixed-point values with `30 + shift` fractional bits.
 * 
 * The floating-point coefficients `B[k]` can then be naively converted to fixed-point coefficients `b[k]`
 * 
 *      shift = 0
 *      b[k] = (int32_t) round(ldexp(B[k], 30)
 * 
 * After this, any further doubling of the coefficients can be compensated for without changing the overall gain by 
 * incrementing `shift`.
 * 
 * To maximize precision, you'll typically want `shift` to be as large as possible while in the worst case to be 
 * considered neither saturates the internal accumulator (which, for safety, should generally be assumed to be 42 bits), 
 * nor saturates the final 32-bit output when `shift` is applied. 
 * 
 * The details of this depend on various details, such as your filter's gain and the statistics of the sequence `x[t]`
 * (e.g. any headroom `x[t]` is known _a priori_ to have).
 * 
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Filter Conversion
 * @parblock
 * 
 * This library includes a python script which converts existing floating-point FIR filter 
 * coefficients into a suitable representation and generates code for easily initializing and
 * executing the filter. See @ref filter_conversion for more.
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Usage Example
 * @parblock
 * 
 * \code{.c}
 *      //// A simple 256-tap averaging filter
 *      #define N       256                     // Tap count
 *      #define B_VAL   ldexp(1.0/N, 30+7)      // Value for (all) coefficients
 * 
 *      const int32_t b[TAPS] =                 // The filter coefficients
 *      { B_VAL, B_VAL, B_VAL, ..., B_VAL };
 *      const right_shift_t shift = 7;          // The (unsigned) right-shift applied to the final accumulator
 *      int32_t state_buff[TAPS] = { 0 };       // Filter state buffer, initialized to 0's
 *      xs3_filter_fir_s32_t filter;            // The filter struct
 * 
 *      #define SAMPLE_COUNT    1024
 *      int32_t x[SAMPLE_COUNT] = { ... };      // Some sequence of input samples
 *      
 *      // Initialize
 *      xs3_filter_fir_s32_init(&filter, state_buff, N, b, shift);
 * 
 *      // Just add the first 64 without processing output samples. (not necessary)
 *      for(unsigned i = 0; i < 64; i++)
 *          xs3_filter_fir_s32_add_sample(&filter, x[i]);
 *      
 *      // Process the rest, generating a sequence of filtered output samples
 *      int32_t y[SAMPLE_COUNT] = { 0 };        //Output samples (first 64 never get updated here)
 *      for(unsigned i = 64; i < SAMPLE_COUNT; i++)
 *          y[i] = xs3_filter_fir_s32(&filter, x[i]);
 * 
 *      // Do something with output sequence
 *      ...
 * \endcode
 * 
 * This example creates a simple 256-tap filter which averages the most recent 256 samples.
 * 
 * Each `b[k]` is @math{2^{29}}, and the final accumulator is right-shifted 7 bits. In the worst case, all input samples 
 * are @math{-2^{31}}. In that case, the final accumulator value is 
 * @math{ 256 \cdot (2^{29} \cdot -2^{31} \cdot 2^{-30}) = -2^{38} }, well below the saturation limit of the 
 * accumulator. After `shift` is applied, that becomes @math{-2^{38} \cdot 2^{-7} = -2^{31}}. Finally, the 32-bit 
 * symmetric saturation logic is applied, making the final output value @math{-2^{31}+1}.
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * 
 * 1. `state` is a circular buffer, and so the index of `x[t]` within `state` changes with each input sample. The 
 *    `state` field of this struct is considered to be opaque -- its exact usage may change between versions.
 * 
 * 2. Ordinarily integer sums are associative, so the order in which elements are added added does not affect the final
 *    result. The sum that the FIR filters use, however, is saturating, with the saturation logic being applied 
 *    throughout the sum. This saturation is a hard non-linearity and is _not_ associative. The details of exactly 
 *    when each tap is accumulated and into which accumulator are complicated and subject to change. It is best to 
 *    construct a filter such that no ordering of the taps will saturate the accumulators.

 * @par Filter Model
 * @parblock
 * 
 * This struct represents an N-tap 16-bit discrete-time FIR Filter.
 * 
 * At each time step, the FIR filter consumes a single 16-bit input sample and produces a single 16-bit output sample.
 * 
 * To process a new input sample and compute a new output sample, use xs3_filter_fir_s16(). To add a new input sample
 * to the filter without computing a new output sample, use xs3_filter_fir_s16_add_sample().
 * 
 * An `N`-tap FIR filter contains `N` 16-bit cofficients (pointed to by `coef`) and `N` `int16_t`s of state data 
 * (pointed to by `state`. The state data is a vector of the `N` most recent input samples. When processing a new input 
 * sample at time step `t`, `x[t]` is the new input sample, `x[t-1]` is the previous input sample, and so on, up to 
 * `x[t-(N-1)]`, which is the oldest input considered when computing the new output sample (see note 1 below). The 
 * coefficients form a vector `b[]`, where `b[k]` is the coefficient by which the `k`th oldest input sample is 
 * multiplied. There is an additional parameter `shift` which scales the output as described below. Both the 
 * coefficients and `shift` are considered to be constants which do not change after initialization (although nothing 
 * should break if they are changed to new valid values).
 * 
 * At time step `t`, the output sample `y[t]` is computed based on the inner product (i.e. sum of element-wise products) 
 * of the coefficients and state data as follows (a more detailed description is below):
 * 
 *     acc = x[t-0] * b[0] + x[t-1] * b[1] + x[t-2] * b[2] + ... + x[t-(N-1)] * b[N-1]
 *     y[t] = acc >> shift
 * 
 * Unlike the 32-bit FIR filters (see `xs3_filter_fir_s16_t`), the products `x[t-k] * b[k]` are the raw 32-bit products
 * of the 16-bit elements. These element-wise products accumulate into a 32-bit accumulator which saturates the sums at 
 * symmetric 32-bit bounds (see @ref saturation).
 * 
 * After all taps have been accumulated, a rounding arithmetic right-shift of `shift` bits is applied to the 64-bit 
 * sum, and the final result is saturated to the symmetric 16-bit range (`-INT16_MAX` to `INT16_MAX` inclusive).
 * 
 * Below is a more detailed description of the operations performed (not including the saturation logic applied by the
 * accumulators).
 *
