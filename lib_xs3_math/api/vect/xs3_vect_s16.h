/**
 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and output shift used by xs3_vect_complex_s16_mul() and

 * 
 * This function is used in conjunction with xs3_vect_complex_s16_mul() to perform a complex element-wise multiplication
 * of two complex 16-bit BFP vectors.
 * 
 * This function computes `a_exp` and `a_shr`.
 * 
 * `a_exp` is the exponent associated with mantissa vector @vector{a}, and must be chosen to be large enough to avoid 
 * overflow when elements of @vector{a} are computed. To maximize precision, this function chooses `a_exp` to be the 
 * smallest exponent known to avoid saturation (see exception below). The `a_exp` chosen by this function is derived 
 * from the exponents and headrooms of associated with the input vectors.
 * 
 * `a_shr` is the shift parameter required by xs3_vect_complex_s16_mul() to achieve the chosen output exponent `a_exp`.
 * 
 * `b_exp` and `c_exp` are the exponents associated with the input mantissa vectors @vector{b} and @vector{c} 
 * respectively.
 * 
 * `b_hr` and `c_hr` are the headroom of @vector{b} and @vector{c} respectively. If the headroom of @vector{b} or 
 * @vector{c} is unknown, they can be obtained by calling xs3_vect_complex_s16_headroom(). Alternatively, the value `0`
 * can always be safely used (but may result in reduced precision).
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * @parblock
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `a_shr` and `c_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      right_shift_t new_a_shr = a_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following conditions should be maintained:
 * * `new_a_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using smaller values than strictly necessary for `a_shr` can result in saturation, and using larger 
 * values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * 
 * * Using the outputs of this function, an output mantissa which would otherwise be `INT16_MIN` will instead saturate 
 *   to `-INT16_MAX`. This is due to the symmetric saturation logic employed by the VPU and is a hardware feature. This 
 *   is a corner case which is usually unlikely and results in 1 LSb of error when it occurs.

/**
 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and output shift used by xs3_vect_s16_mul().
 * 
 * This function is used in conjunction with xs3_vect_s16_mul() to perform an element-wise multiplication of two 16-bit
 * BFP vectors.
 * 
 * This function computes `a_exp` and `a_shr`.
 * 
 * `a_exp` is the exponent associated with mantissa vector @vector{a}, and must be chosen to be large enough to avoid 
 * overflow when elements of @vector{a} are computed. To maximize precision, this function chooses `a_exp` to be the 
 * smallest exponent known to avoid saturation (see exception below). The `a_exp` chosen by this function is derived 
 * from the exponents and headrooms of associated with the input vectors.
 * 
 * `a_shr` is an arithmetic right-shift applied by xs3_vect_complex_s16_mul() to the 32-bit products of input elements 
 * to achieve the chosen output exponent `a_exp`.
 * 
 * `b_exp` and `c_exp` are the exponents associated with the input mantissa vectors @vector{b} and @vector{c} 
 * respectively.
 * 
 * `b_hr` and `c_hr` are the headroom of @vector{b} and @vector{c} respectively. If the headroom of @vector{b} or 
 * @vector{c} is unknown, they can be obtained by calling xs3_vect_s16_headroom(). Alternatively, the value `0` can 
 * always be safely used (but may result in reduced precision).
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * @parblock
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `a_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t a_exp;
 *      right_shift_t a_shr;
 *      xs3_vect_s16_mul_prepare(&a_exp, &a_shr, b_exp, c_exp, b_hr, c_hr);
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      a_shr = a_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 *      a_exp = desired_exp;
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following conditions should be maintained:
 * * `a_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using a smaller value than strictly necessary for `a_shr` can result in saturation, and using larger 
 * values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.
 * @endparblock
 * 
 * @par Notes
 * @parblock
 * 
 * * Using the outputs of this function, an output mantissa which would otherwise be `INT16_MIN` will instead saturate 
 *   to `-INT16_MAX`. This is due to the symmetric saturation logic employed by the VPU and is a hardware feature. This 
 *   is a corner case which is usually unlikely and results in 1 LSb of error when it occurs.

/**
 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and shift parameter used by xs3_vect_s16_sqrt().
 * 
 * This function is used in conjunction withx xs3_vect_s16_sqrt() to compute the square root of elements of a 16-bit
 * BFP vector.
 * 
 * This function computes `a_exp` and `b_shr`.
 * 
 * `a_exp` is the exponent associated with output mantissa vector @vector{a}, and should be chosen to maximize the 
 * precision of the results. To that end, this function chooses `a_exp` to be the smallest exponent known to avoid 
 * saturation of the resulting mantissa vector @vector{a}. It is derived from the exponent and headroom of the input
 * BFP vector.
 * 
 * `b_shr` is the shift parameter required by xs3_vect_s16_sqrt() to achieve the chosen output exponent `a_exp`.
 * 
 * `b_exp` is the exponent associated with the input mantissa vector @vector{b}.
 * 
 * `b_hr` is the headroom of @vector{b}. If it is unknown, it can be obtained using xs3_vect_s16_headroom(). 
 * Alternatively, the value `0` can always be safely used (but may result in reduced precision).
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * @parblock
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `b_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t a_exp;
 *      right_shift_t b_shr;
 *      xs3_vect_s16_mul_prepare(&a_exp, &b_shr, b_exp, c_exp, b_hr, c_hr);
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      b_shr = b_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 *      a_exp = desired_exp;
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following condition should be maintained:
 * * `b_hr + b_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using smaller values than strictly necessary for `b_shr` can result in saturation, and using larger 
 * values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.
 * 
 * Also, if a larger exponent is used than necessary, a larger `depth` parameter (see xs3_vect_s16_sqrt()) will be 
 * required to achieve the same precision, as the results are computed bit by bit, starting with the most significant
 * bit.
