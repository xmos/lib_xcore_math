/**
 * @page page_bfp_init_h  bfp_init.h
 * 
 * This header contains functions for initializing the structs representing block floating-point
 * vectors. Initialization comes in two flavors: static and dynamic. 
 * 
 * Static initialization requires the user to supply the buffer which is used to store the mantissa 
 * vector. Static initiaization is accomplished using the `bfp_*_init()` functions.
 * 
 * Dynamic initialization allocates the buffer for the mantissa vectors from the heap using `malloc()`
 * (unless overridden by the user via configuration of @ref XS3_MALLOC).  Dynamic allocation is 
 * accomplished using the `bfp_*_alloc()` functions.  If dynamically allocated vectors are to be 
 * temporary, to avoid memory leaks they much be deallocated using the corresponding `bfp_*_dealloc()`
 * functions.
 * 
 * @note This header is included automatically through `bfp_math.h`.
 * 
 * @see  `bfp_s16_t`, `bfp_s32_t`, `bfp_complex_s16_t`, `bfp_complex_s32_t`,
