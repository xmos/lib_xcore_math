 * 
 * The operation performed is:
 * @f[

 *      \text{ for } 0 \le f \le N/2
 * @f]
 * where @math{x[n]} is the BFP vector initially represented by `x`, and @math{X[f]} is the DFT of @math{x[n]} 
 * represented by the returned pointer.
 * 
 * The exponent, headroom, length and data contents of `x` are all updated by this function, though `x->data` will 
 * continue to point to the same address.
 * 
 * `x->length` must be a power of 2, and must be no larger than `(1<<MAX_DIT_FFT_LOG2)`.
 * 
 * This function returns a `bfp_complex_s32_t` pointer. <b>This points to the same address as `x`.</b> This is intended
 * as a convenience for user code.
 * 
 * Upon completion, the spectrum data is encoded in `x->data` as specified for real DFTs in @ref spectrum_packing. That 
 * is, `x->data[f]` for `1 <= f < (x->length)` represent @math{X[f]} for @math{1 \le f \lt (N/2)} and `x->data[0]`
 * represents @math{X[0] + j X[N/2]}.
